        "Text_article": [
            "<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati\u2019s new AI venture, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/thinking-machines-lab-is-ex-openai-cto-mira-muratis-new-startup/\">Thinking Machines Lab</a>, has gained two new prominent advisors: Bob McGrew, previously OpenAI\u2019s chief research officer, and Alec Radford, a former OpenAI researcher behind many of the company\u2019s more transformative innovations.  </p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thinking Machines Lab\u2019s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thinkingmachines.ai/\">website</a> was quietly updated with McGrew and Radford\u2019s names sometime in March. A spokesperson for the startup didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McGrew joined OpenAI as a member of the technical staff in 2017 and was promoted to VP of research in 2018 before assuming the role of chief research officer. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/openais-chief-research-officer-has-left/\">He left in September 2024</a>, saying at the time that he intended to take a \u201cbreak.\u201d </p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Radford, who departed OpenAI late last year to pursue independent research after close to a decade at the company, was the lead author of OpenAI\u2019s seminal research paper on generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs). GPTs underpin OpenAI\u2019s most popular products, including the company\u2019s AI-powered chatbot platform, ChatGPT. Radford also worked on several models in the company\u2019s GPT series as well as the speech recognition model Whisper and DALL-E, OpenAI\u2019s image-generating model.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thinking Machines Lab has so far been vague about its research agenda and product roadmap. But in an announcement in February, the startup said that it intends to build tooling to \u201cmake AI work for [people\u2019s] unique needs and goals\u201d and to create AI systems that are \u201cmore widely understood, customizable, and generally capable\u201d than those currently available.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murati is heading up Thinking Machines Lab as CEO. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/report-openais-ex-cto-mira-murati-has-recruited-openai-co-founder-john-schulman/\">OpenAI co-founder John Schulman</a> is the company\u2019s chief scientist, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/openais-chief-research-officer-has-left/\">Barret Zoph</a>, who led model post-training at OpenAI, is the CTO.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://x.com/miramurati/status/1839025700009030027?s=46\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Murati left OpenAI last October after six years at the company</a>. She came to OpenAI as VP of applied AI and partnerships. After being promoted to CTO in 2022, Murati led the company\u2019s work on\u00a0<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/dall-e/\">DALL-E</a>, and the code-generating system\u00a0<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/openai-upgrades-its-natural-language-ai-coder-codex-and-kicks-off-private-beta/\">Codex</a>, which powered early versions of\u00a0<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/github-copilot/\">GitHub\u2019s Copilot</a>\u00a0programming assistant.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At one point, Murati was said to be in talks to raise over $100 million from unnamed VC firms for Thinking Machines Lab, which counts dozens of employees from top AI labs including OpenAI and Google DeepMind among its ranks.</p>",

            "<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snapchat is introducing Sponsored AI Lenses, a new ad format that lets brands engage with consumers in an immersive way. While Snapchat has offered brands the opportunity to pay for sponsored lenses on the platform for years, now they can leverage AI-generated experiences powered by Snap\u2019s proprietary generative AI technology.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With these interactive lenses, brands can reach and engage users in a more fun and interactive way when compared to traditional ads, as they allow users to take selfies to see themselves transported into different AI-generated scenes. </p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When users take a selfie for an AI Lens, Snap analyzes their face to integrate them into an AI-generated scene, the company told TechCrunch in an email. The AI Lens uses a preset prompt and pose to create immersive transformations, providing up to 10 different experiences within one Lens.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cOver the past two years, we\u2019ve refined our generative AI technology to make high-quality creative execution fast and efficient,\u201d the company said in a blog post. \u201cSponsored AI Lenses eliminate the need for 3D and VFX design, replacing them with AI-generated templates that can help cut production timelines.\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brands that have already used the new ad format include Tinder and Uber. Tinder\u2019s ad allowed users to generate a personalized image of themselves with the caption \u201cMy 2025 Dating Vibe,\u201d and Uber\u2019s let users do the same, but with a Thanksgiving twist.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap found that users spent more time engaging with Sponsored AI Lenses compared to standard Lenses, as both Uber and Tinder saw higher than average playtimes while using the new AI creative format.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch marks the latest way that Snap is exploring with generative AI and integrating the technology into its platform. Last month, the company introduced its first-ever video generative AI Lenses. In February, Snap <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/snap-unveils-ai-text-to-image-model-for-mobile-devices/\">unveiled an AI text-to-image research model</a>\u00a0for mobile devices that will power some of Snapchat\u2019s features in the coming month. </p>",

            "<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Tuesday, Amazon debuted a new generative AI model, Nova Sonic, capable of natively processing voice and generating natural-sounding speech. Amazon claims that Sonic\u2019s performance is competitive with frontier voice models from OpenAI and Google on benchmarks measuring speed, speech recognition, and conversational quality.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nova Sonic is Amazon\u2019s answer to newer AI voice models such as the model powering <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/24/openai-says-its-ai-voice-assistant-is-now-better-to-chat-with/\">ChatGPT\u2019s Voice Mode</a>, which feel more natural to speak with than the more rigid models from Amazon Alexa\u2019s early days. Recent technological breakthroughs have made legacy models and the digital assistants they underpin, such as Alexa and Apple\u2019s Siri, seem incredibly stilted by comparison.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nova Sonic is available through Bedrock, Amazon\u2019s developer platform for building enterprise AI applications, via a new bi-directional streaming API. In a press release, Amazon called Nova Sonic \u201cthe most cost-efficient\u201d AI voice model on the market, and around 80% less expensive than OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Components of Nova Sonic are already powering <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/with-alexa-amazon-makes-an-intriguing-play-in-the-consumer-agent-space/\">Alexa+, Amazon\u2019s upgraded digital voice assistant</a>, according to Amazon SVP and Head Scientist of AGI Rohit Prasad.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an interview, Prasad told TechCrunch that Nova Sonic builds on Amazon\u2019s expertise in \u201clarge orchestration systems,\u201d the technical scaffolding that makes up Alexa. Compared to rival AI voice models, Nova Sonic excels at routing user requests to different APIs, said Prasad. This capability helps Nova Sonic \u201cknow\u201d when it needs to fetch real-time information from the internet, parse a proprietary data source, or take action in an external application \u2014 and use the appropriate tool to do it.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During a two-way dialogue, Nova Sonic waits to speak \u201cat the appropriate time,\u201d taking into account a speaker\u2019s pauses and interruptions, says Amazon. It also generates a text transcript for the user\u2019s speech, which developers can use for various applications.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nova Sonic is less prone to speech recognition errors than other AI voice models, according to Prasad, meaning the model is relatively good at understanding a user\u2019s intent even if they mumble, misspeak, or are in a noisy setting. On a benchmark measuring speech recognition across languages and dialects, Multilingual LibriSpeech, Amazon says Nova Sonic achieved a word error rate (WER) of just 4.2% when averaged across English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish. That means\u00a0that roughly four out of every 100 words from the model differed from a human transcription\u00a0in those languages. </p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On another benchmark measuring loud interactions with multiple participants, Augmented Multi Party Interaction, Amazon says Nova Sonic was 46.7% more accurate in terms of WER than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/openai-upgrades-its-transcription-and-voice-generating-ai-models/\">OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o-transcribe</a> model. Nova Sonic also has industry-leading speed, with an average perceived latency of 1.09 seconds, according to Amazon. That makes it faster than the GPT-4o model powering OpenAI\u2019s Realtime API, which responds in 1.18 seconds, per benchmarking by Artificial Analysis.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prasad says Nova Sonic is a part of Amazon\u2019s broader strategy to build AGI (artificial general intelligence), which the company defines as \u201cAI systems that can do anything a human can do on a computer.\u201d Moving forward, Prasad says Amazon plans to release more AI models that can understand different modalities, including image, video, and voice, as well as \u201cother sensory data that are relevant if you bring things into the physical world.\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon\u2019s AGI division, which Prasad oversees, seems to be playing a larger role in the company\u2019s product strategy these days. Just last week, Amazon <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/amazon-unveils-nova-act-an-ai-agent-that-uses-a-web-browser/\">launched a preview of Nova Act</a>, a browser-using AI model that appears to be powering elements of Alexa+ and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/03/amazons-new-ai-agent-will-shop-third-party-stores-for-you/\">Amazon\u2019s Buy for Me feature</a>. Starting with Nova Sonic, Prasad says the company wants to offer more of its internal AI models for developers to build with.</p>",

            "<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A founder who has carved out a name for himself building products to help restaurants connect better with would-be diners has raised $50 million for his latest startup: a new take on the idea of customer loyalty.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.blackbird.xyz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Blackbird Labs</a> has built a payments-meets-loyalty-meets-blockchain platform for restaurants to grow repeat business while reducing some of the friction around transactions. Now, with with some 1,000 restaurants signed up, CEO Ben Leventhal said Blackbird plans to use the money to launch its newest product, a cross-restaurant \u201cpoints\u201d service it\u2019s calling Blackbird Club, as well as to expand into more markets outside of New York (its Homebase), San Francisco and Charleston, South Carolina.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(Charleston, you ask? \u201cCharleston punches above its class,\u201d Leventhal said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a great restaurant city for its size.\u201d It also appears to the be Blackbird\u2019s equivalent of New Zealand for Meta, with Leventhal calling it \u201ca good test market for us.\u201d)</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spark Capital, a new backer, is leading this latest round, with participation also from Coinbase Ventures, Amex Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, three investors that backed Blackbird in its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/04/resy-and-eater-co-founder-raises-24m-for-blackbird-a-restaurant-loyalty-platform/\">$24 million Series A in 2023</a>. Valuation is not being disclosed but for a point of reference, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/510199-66/company/profile#insights\">PitchBook notes</a> that the startup was valued at around $124 million in that last round. The startup has raised $85 million to-date.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Coinbase and Amex are strategic names in that list.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amex acquired Resy, a reservations platform that Leventhal previously founded, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/15/american-express-is-acquiring-resy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in 2019</a>. The two companies \u2014 Resy and Blackbird \u2014 are not integrating now but \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say we will,\u201d Leventhal said. Previous to Resy, the third restaurant-focused startup Leventhal founded, the food blog Eater, was also acquired: it\u2019s now <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/10/vox-buys-curbed-network-for-a-reported-stock-cash-blend-worth-20-30-million/\">part of Vox</a>. No plans on how and if to partner there.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Blackbird describes its Flynet payment service as an layer-three transaction protocol built on Coinbase\u2019s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.base.org/\">BASE</a>. Diners can use it to pay for meals at the table via Blackbird\u2019s app, as well as to redeem loyalty points when they visit restaurants.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It\u2019s worth asking whether blockchain was strictly a necessary part of the mix? There are plenty of other loyalty and payment programs in the market \u2014 include a number that are direct competitors to Blackbird like Punchh, Toast, Lightspeed, etc. \u2014 that are built on more conventional financial structures.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI don\u2019t think it necessarily \u2018has to be built on blockchain,\u2019\u201d Leventhal said. \u201cVisa\u2019s network, more or less, was created using the same principles that we\u2019re using for Flynet, and obviously they didn\u2019t have blockchain.\u201d </p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But he pointed out too that \u201cthere are a few things that we do believe that over time will be important opportunities, and those opportunities will be based on being on-chain.\u201d These include how Blackbird and restaurants hold customer profiles and activity, he said. \u201cConsumers will be able to continue to own that profile.\u201d It also relates to how Blackbird envisions its engagement with restaurants, he said: each restaurant customer ultimately will be a shareholder of Blackbird.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You might think that with two startups dedicated to the consumer-facing side of the restaurant trade that Leventhal might have had his fill of the business. As it turns out, he\u2019s still hungry for more.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Owning restaurants has long been a challenging enterprise, but the economy and changing consumer habits have especially knocked the world of restaurants around a lot in the last few years. </p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leventhal cites figures from the National Restaurant Association that note that the average profitability of restaurants these days is <a href=\"https://restaurant.org/research-and-media/research/restaurant-economic-insights/analysis-commentary/bottom-line-impact-of-rising-costs-for-restaurants/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">under 5%</a>, compared to an average of around 20% in the early Noughties. </p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While platforms like Instagram and TikTok have turned the world into armchair foodies, producing legions of people who virally flock to the latest and coolest cafe, they are doing this amid a time of rapidly declining margins and heightened price sensitivity. These are areas that are only going to get tougher if the U.S. really locks down on its latest tariff hikes.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThere is a disconnect in the restaurant industry between the popularity and the intensity of consumer love for restaurants and ultimately the profitability of the industry,\u201d he said.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That disconnect, of course, in startup thinking means opportunity.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThe restaurant industry is made up of millions of local, small business owners around the world. Those restaurants are at the mercy of tech platforms that can charge a large, and often growing, percentage of a restaurant\u2019s margin,\u201d Arianna Simpson General Partner at a16z crypto, told TechCrunch over email. </p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She believes this is specifically where blockchain can play a role: improving that margin structure. \u201cBen\u2019s vision is for a network that is owned by the restaurants and the diners themselves, which is something that only blockchains enable.\u201d Today, Blackbird is already saving its restaurant customers 3-4% in payment processing fees, she added.</p>",

            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Organic batteries, which are built from some of the most abundant chemicals here on Earth, including carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, has been perhaps the most frustrating failure.

            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And the scale of XL Batteries\u2019 installations can be, well, extra large.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company exclusively told TechCrunch that it has commissioned a demonstration unit for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.stolt-nielsen.com/our-businesses/stolthaven-terminals/\">Stolthaven Terminals</a>, a company that specializes in petrochemical storage. The first unit will be small, relatively speaking, but once it works the kinks out, the company can quickly build larger batteries, Sisto said.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of the reason Sisto is so optimistic is because a key component of the battery is nothing more than a storage tank.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIf we took two of [Stolthaven\u2019s] biggest tanks, it\u2019d be a 700 megawatt-hour battery,\u201d Sisto said. That\u2019s enough to power around <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/electricity-use-in-homes.php\">25,000 homes</a> for a entire day. \u201cI believe they have 400 tanks on their site in Houston.\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">XL Batteries is building what are known as flow batteries. A basic flow battery consists of two tanks connected to pumps that flow two fluids past a membrane. Charging the battery pushes ions up a metaphorical hill, storing them in one of the fluids. When discharging, those ions flow back to the other side, releasing electrons in the process.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Flow batteries are an old technology, first invented in the late 1800s. But their bulk and relatively low energy storage held them back. Newer models have helped boost energy storage, but they\u2019re still relatively expensive because the fluids they use are corrosive, necessitating costly materials for the pumps and other equipment.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Organic batteries have been posited for a while, but they have proven elusive because when most organic molecules are laden with extra electrons, they tend to quickly break apart. Those that have lasted longer have required refrigeration, and even then they fall apart in a couple months, Sisto said.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even with a more stable molecule, Sisto knew that XL Batteries had to be cheaper if the company was to succeed. He got a glimmer of hope during his research at Columbia University when an organic compound he was investigating broke the record for the highest number of electrons accepted into a single molecule. At the time, that molecule had to be suspended in an organic solvent, which was pricey and flammable. Eventually, he and his collaborators were able to make it stable in pH-neutral water. At that point, he knew they could build a company around it.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of XL Batteries\u2019 installations consists of three parts: one 40-foot shipping container and two tanks. The company\u2019s proprietary membrane and other components fit the shipping container, and one or more of those is then hooked up to the storage tanks. The size of the tanks dictates the battery\u2019s capacity, while the number of shipping containers dictates how quickly the battery can charge or discharge.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because the company is using so much off-the-shelf technology, Sisto says that XL Batteries can start building larger batteries soon. \u201cThe commercial design is is significantly done,\u201d he said. The company is working with an engineering firm that has designed other flow batteries before. \u201cThey have all those pieces in place.\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of early customers like Stolthaven, XL Batteries is looking to work with independent power producers to build batteries to support the grid, particularly in Texas where such installations have quickly become commonplace. </p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe believe the project level economics of this are very compelling,\u201d Sisto said.</p>",

            "<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dark kitchens\u2013 also referred to as ghost kitchens, cloud kitchens, or virtual kitchens\u2013 often receive criticism for their food quality. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sizl.com/\">Sizl</a>, a cook-to-order delivery service based in Chicago, seeks to change this perception by delivering meals made with fresh ingredients in around 30 minutes flat.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company announced its recent $3.5 million seed round on Tuesday, at a $12 million post-money valuation.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike typical dark kitchens, which serve as shared spaces for various restaurants, Sizl says it runs its own kitchens with a small team of Ukrainian cooks and local culinary talent from Chicago who prepare the food. It also has its own delivery couriers and even a mobile app where you can earn rewards.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since dark kitchens typically operate without a traditional dine-in space and focus solely on delivering takeout orders, this can lead to inconsistency in the food quality and freshness.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A key selling point for Sizl\u2019s target audience, health-conscious customers looking for a quick bite, is that the service provides \u201cfresh ingredients,\u201d co-founder and COO Anastasia Kalinkina told TechCrunch.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sizl claims it sources meat and produce from local suppliers, including Greensys, an organic farm in central Illinois. However, the company admits to also working with large distributors like US Foods and Sysco, although it emphasizes that a significant portion of its ingredients come from local sources.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, many ghost kitchens offer a wide variety of foods but lack specialization. Sizl stands out by focusing mainly on Eastern European cuisine, which could help it set itself apart from local eateries.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sizl\u2019s menu includes only 60 items at a time, ranging from dishes like chicken kyiv and pierogies to everyday meals like grilled cheese and spaghetti bolognese. Sizl has even incorporated Kalinkina\u2019s family recipes, including her grandmother\u2019s borscht and syrniki.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sizl founders Kalinkina, Alex Kolesnikov (CEO), Nick Delitski, and Kyrylo Kupin (CMO) are originally from Ukraine and have prior experience in building a dark kitchen chain. They previously built <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/local-kitchen\">Local Kitchen</a>, which Kolesnikov noted scaled to $46 million in annual revenue.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another negative association with dark kitchens is that they rely on third-party delivery platforms, saturating Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Grubhub apps with virtual brands that are often copycats of each other.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Sizl is also available on these apps, it differentiates itself with its own mobile app that uses game mechanics to engage customers. Every time a customer orders or logs in to the app, they collect themed cards that can be used to unlock rewards. Sizl also has an in-app currency (mojis) and mini games. Additionally, Sizl offers 3% cash back on all orders.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The recent round was led by Yellow Rocks!, with participation from Kinetik, and several angel investors, including Mike Alexandrovski, who co-founded delivery startup Borzo.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding will go toward opening up to four additional kitchens in Chicago this year, adding to its two existing locations. It\u2019s also exploring expansion into Boston, Charlotte, and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sizl said it already has a Series A round planned for later this year or early 2026.</p>",

            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Meta\u2019s blog post about the launch doesn\u2019t share the exact restrictions that teens will be placed under, the company told TechCrunch in an email that teens will only receive messages from people they follow or have messaged before.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, only teens\u2019 friends can see and reply to their stories. Tags, Mentions, and comments will also be limited to people they follow or who are their friends.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teens will also receive reminders to leave the social networks after using them for an hour a day. Plus, they will be enrolled into \u201cQuiet mode\u201d overnight. </p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the new restrictions on Instagram, teens under 16 will not be allowed to go live on the platform unless their parents give them permission to do so. Plus, teens under 16 will need to get parental permission to turn off the app\u2019s feature that blurs images containing suspected nudity in DMs.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes announced on Tuesday demonstrate Meta\u2019s latest step toward addressing teen mental health concerns tied to social media. These concerns have been\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/10/state-attorneys-endorse-social-media-warning-labels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raised by the U.S. Surgeon General</a>\u00a0and several states, some of which have even\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/to-protect-teens-on-social-media-new-york-targets-the-algorithms-8b5feaae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">begun restricting teens from using social media</a>\u00a0without a parent\u2019s consent.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has shared some insight into how Teen Accounts are doing on Instagram, as the company says it has moved 54 million teens into Teen Accounts. Meta says there are still many more to go, as the feature continues to roll out globally. The company also shared that 97% of teens ages 13-15 keep their built-in protections on, Meta says.</p>",

            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hardware and consulting company on Monday announced IBM z17, the latest version of its mainframe computer hardware. This fully encrypted mainframe is powered by an IBM Telum II processor and is designed for more than 250 AI use cases, the company says, including AI agents and generative AI.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mainframes might seem like old hat, but they\u2019re used by 71% of Fortune 500 companies today, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.rocketsoftware.com/en-us/insights/mainframe-turns-60#:~:text=Mainframes%20are%20used%20by%2071%25%20of%20Fortune%20500%20companies.\">according to one source</a>. In 2024, the mainframe market was worth an estimated $5.3 billion, per consulting firm Market Research Future.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The z17 can process 450 billion inference operations in a day, a 50% increase over its predecessor, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/04/the-venerable-mainframe-rolls-on-at-ibm-with-the-release-of-the-z16/\">the IBM z16</a>, which was released in 2022 and ran on the company\u2019s original Tellum processor. The system is designed to be able to fully integrate with other hardware, software, and open-source tools.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tina Tarquinio, VP of product management and design for IBM Z, told TechCrunch that this mainframe upgrade has been in the works for five years \u2014\u00a0well before the current AI frenzy that started with the release of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/27/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/\">OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT</a> in November 2022.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IBM spent more than 2,000 research hours getting feedback from over 100 customers as it built the z17, Tarquinio said. She thinks it\u2019s interesting to see that, now, five years later, the feedback they got aligned with where the market ended up heading.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt has been wild knowing that we\u2019re introducing an AI accelerator, and then seeing, especially in the later half of 2022, all of the changes in the industry regarding AI,\u201d Tarquinio told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s been really exciting. I think the biggest point has been [that] we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know about what\u2019s coming, right? So the possibilities are really unlimited in terms of what AI can help us do.\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The z17 is set up to adapt and accommodate where the AI market heads, Tarquinio said. The mainframe will support 48 IBM Spyre AI accelerator chips upon release, with the plan to bring that number up to 96 within 12 months.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe are purposely building in headroom,\u201d Tarquinio said. \u201cWe\u2019re purposely building in AI agility. So as new models are introduced, [we\u2019re] making sure that we\u2019ve built in the headroom for bigger, larger models \u2014 models that maybe need more local memory to talk to each other. We\u2019ve built in that because we know it\u2019s really the approach that will change, right? The new models will come and go.\u201d</p>",

            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nova Reel, announced in December 2024, was Amazon\u2019s first foray into the generative video space. It competes with models from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/28/openai-plans-to-bring-soras-video-generator-to-chatgpt/\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/23/googles-new-ai-video-model-veo-2-will-cost-50-cents-per-second/\">Google</a>, and others in what\u2019s fast becoming a crowded market. </p>",

Users can provide a prompt up to 4,000 characters long to generate up to a two-minute video composed of six-second shots.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nova Reel 1.1 also introduces a new mode called \u201cMultishot Manual.\u201d In this mode, the model can reference an image along with a prompt to offer more control over a video shot\u2019s composition. According to Fuentes, given a 1280 x 720-resolution image and 512-maximum-character prompt, Multishot Manual can generate videos containing up to 20 shots.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nova Reel is only available through AWS platforms and services, including Bedrock, Amazon\u2019s AI dev suite, and customers must request access.

            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Video-generating models are trained on a vast number of examples of videos to \u201clearn\u201d the patterns in these videos to generate new clips. Some companies train models on copyrighted videos without obtaining permission from the owners or creators, and, when these models \u201c<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/image-generating-ai-can-copy-and-paste-from-training-data-raising-ip-concerns/\">regurgitate</a>\u201d copyrighted stills, it exposes users of the models to IP lawsuits.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon hasn\u2019t revealed the source of Reel\u2019s training data, nor has it provided an explicit way for creators possibly feeding the models\u2019 datasets with their videos to opt out. The company has, however, said that it\u2019ll protect any AWS customers accused of violating copyright with media generated by its models, in keeping with its indemnification policy.</p>",

            "<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amid a morning of pandemonium on Wall Street, a popular news aggregator on X, known as <a href=\"https://x.com/DeItaone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Walter Bloomberg</a>, posted a false report declaring that President Trump was considering a 90-day pause on his controversial tariff proposal.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This news was not true, and yet, index funds like the Dow Jones whipsawed \u2014 rapidly rising, before reversing course minutes later. This type of volatility is more meaningful than a stock\u2019s typical rise and fall throughout any given day, which is why the false report garnered so much attention.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though the Walter Bloomberg account is not affiliated with any news organization and has no connection to Bloomberg News, the account has long been considered a reliable source of tech and business news. Rather than writing its own posts, Walter Bloomberg publicly posts news headlines as they hit the Bloomberg Terminal. </p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bloomberg Terminal is an expensive subscription-only service that financial professionals use for real-time market data, which includes breaking news headlines. Sometimes, the headlines from outlets like CNBC and Bloomberg hit the Terminal before the stories are published online, making accounts like Walter Bloomberg a useful follow for quick news.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday, a series of reporting errors from CNBC and Reuters, which were then amplified by the Walter Bloomberg account on X, appears to have directly affected the stock market during an already chaotic day.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The headline posted by Walter Bloomberg, which was deleted since it is not true, said: \u201cHASSETT: TRUMP IS CONSIDERING A 90-DAY PAUSE IN TARIFFS FOR ALL COUNTRIES EXCEPT CHINA.\u201d </p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The White House\u2019s rapid response team quote-tweeted the now-deleted Walter Bloomberg post and denied that Kevin Hassett, Trump\u2019s director of the National Economic Council, made these statements.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To prove the point, this White House-affiliated account <a href=\"https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1909254335822692548\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shared a clip </a>from Fox News, where the false statement seems to have originated.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response to billionaire Bill Ackman\u2019s <a href=\"https://x.com/BillAckman/status/1908992002366292286\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">plea</a> for the Trump administration to institute a 90-day pause on the tariff plan, an anchor on Fox asked Hassett, \u201cWould you do a 90-day pause? Would you consider that?\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hassett responded, \u201cYou know, I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide\u2026 But I would urge everyone, especially Bill, to ease off the rhetoric a little bit.\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked on X where he got this news from, Walter Bloomberg <a href=\"https://x.com/DeItaone/status/1909252731769888918\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> that the headline he posted was from Reuters.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Walter Bloomberg did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement, Reuters told TechCrunch: \u201cReuters, drawing from a headline on CNBC, published a story on April 7 saying White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett had said that President Donald Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause on all countries except China. The White House denied the report. Reuters has withdrawn the incorrect report and regrets its error.\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, Walter Bloomberg pointed the finger at Reuters, which then pointed the finger at CNBC.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A CNBC spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement, \u201cAs we were chasing the news of the market moves in real-time, we aired unconfirmed information in a banner. Our reporters quickly made a correction on air.\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Walter Bloomberg <a href=\"https://x.com/DeItaone/status/1909251526024904891\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">broke</a> from its typical robotic tone with a simple \u201cwtf,\u201d then screenshotted the Terminal\u2019s report from CNBC that said that the White House is not aware of any plan for a 90-day pause.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It\u2019s likely that Wall Street traders saw this news on the Terminal itself, not from the Walter Bloomberg aggregator.

            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nikola filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February and has said it hopes to sell its business by the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/bankrupt-nikola-wants-to-sell-its-whole-business-by-april/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">middle of this month</a>.

            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Milton\u2019s interest in Nikola is the latest twist in the company\u2019s long, odd story. Milton founded the company in 2014, took it public in one of the first high-profile special purpose acquisition mergers in 2020, stepped down a few months later after fraud allegations surfaced, and was convicted in 2022. He was sentenced to four years in prison in 2023, and just last month was pardoned by President Trump.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Nikola struggled with battery fires, recalls, and its overall financial health before filing for bankruptcy.   </p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lawyers for a Nevada entity known as ISSO LLC said in a <a href=\"https://document.epiq11.com/document/getdocumentbycode?docId=4458291&amp;projectCode=NKL&amp;source=DM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filing</a> last week that it submitted a bid for Nikola assets on March 21. As part of the bid process, Nikola agreed to let ISSO inspect the factory. But the company refused to allow video or pictures to be taken and prohibited a specific ISSO representative from entering the factory.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The name of that representative has been redacted in the bankruptcy court filings. A lawyer representing Nikola described the person during an emergency hearing last week, and his <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2025/04/03/nikola-trevor-milton-bankruptcy-bid-process.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">description fit Milton</a>. Milton\u2019s father, Lance Milton, and one of his lawyers, Troy Wallin, appear on paperwork that ISSO LLC has filed with various states over the last few years.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A person familiar with Milton\u2019s intentions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed to TechCrunch he is pursuing a bid. A spokesperson for Milton did not respond to a request for comment.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At last week\u2019s hearing, the lawyer for Nikola said Milton\u2019s interest was \u201cnothing more than a publicity stunt.\u201d Judge Thomas Horan said the company \u201cjustified why that is necessary\u201d to prohibit Milton from entering the facility.

Meanwhile, U.S. ports are bracing for a proposed rule that could slap ocean carriers with up to $1.5 million per port call if their ships are made in China \u2014 or even if they have one on order.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt\u2019s horrifying for our customers,\u201d Petersen said at the event. \u201cFor some of these companies, for a lot of our customers, [the spate of changes] will be existential kind of life-and-death decisions.\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Flexport, one of the largest customs brokerages in the U.S., has had no choice but to step up fast. Already this year, Petersen said he has talked in person to 200 customers, many of them relying heavily on Vietnam for production, thinking they\u2019d diversified away from China just in time.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Petersen said he wasn\u2019t surprised that Vietnam was slapped with a tariff of 46%. \u201cI expected there to be duties pretty much everywhere, and that is what we saw.\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The real surprise, he noted, was the little-noticed announcement that the U.S. would be shutting down the de minimis program for imports globally. The change affects the business models of e-commerce giants like Temu and Shein, as well as the thousands of Shopify-based stores that handle fulfillment from nearby Mexico.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cOver 30% of all the e-commerce brands \u2014 the large ones \u2014 have set up their fulfillment in Mexico,\u201d Petersen explained. \u201cSo that\u2019s all going away, or at least the duty-free aspect of it.\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Petersen \u2014 a believer in so-called <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">founder mode</a> who talks with up to 50 employees a day \u2014 didn\u2019t wait to start getting the word out. \u201cI had to go dig in and try to understand this stuff,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cAnd then when we started to feel like I had understanding, I wrote a blog post about de minimis. I had hedge fund guys texting. We were [also] the first to notice that semiconductors were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/typesfast/status/1907545342658359527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">carved out</a>. I had one of the biggest investors in Nvidia saying, \u2018Where are you seeing this?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018It [says it in the new law].\u2019\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unsurprisingly, what Flexport strove to offer in the immediate aftermath of Trump\u2019s new tariff war wasn\u2019t just logistics guidance, as Petersen explained it. It was steadiness. Flexport employees needed it, certainly. \u201cRule one in a crisis is everybody will rally around the calmest person in the room,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the leader of a company. You can\u2019t be freaking out, even if you are inside; your company will freak out.\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cooler heads are something that Flexport\u2019s customers need right now, too. With tariff tables, customs rules, and shipping costs all in flux, clients have been turning to Flexport to make sense of what feels like complete chaos.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And even more disruption looms. A pending proposal from the U.S. Trade Representative threatens to impose staggering port fees on Chinese-built ships, and even on ships owned by carriers with Chinese-made vessels in their fleet.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThey\u2019re saying they\u2019re gonna put in a fee\u00a0\u2026 if the ship\u2019s made in China, I think it\u2019s a million dollars\u00a0\u2026 a million and a half every time they come to the United States,\u201d Petersen said.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The goal, according to the administration, is to stimulate American shipbuilding. The likely result, in Petersen\u2019s view, is more widespread costs passed along to U.S. importers, and a lot of maritime workers who lose their jobs as ships look to minimize the number of stops they make.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite all the havoc, Petersen isn\u2019t ready to call it the end of free trade. \u201cLikely, this is not permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cI did talk to one of the Cabinet members\u00a0\u2026 who told me that Liberation Day will be the start and not the end of the process.\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said he was encouraged that some countries were responding, even ahead of the Trump administration\u2019s maneuverings. \u201cVietnam and Israel both came to the table and eliminated all duties on American goods this week,\u201d Petersen noted.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That may offer a path forward: quiet negotiations, reciprocal deals, and a reshaped global supply chain. In the meantime, Petersen and his team are answering phones, tweeting up a storm, and breaking webinar platforms to keep the supply chain moving \u2014 and to keep the freakouts at bay.</p>",

            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Baglino was a longtime employee at Tesla, starting at the company in 2006, two years before Elon Musk took over as CEO.

            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The privacy page states: \u201cWaymo may share data to improve and analyze its functionality and to tailor products, services, ads, and offers to your interests.

Body language? \u2014 or whether Waymo is using the data to train in-house models or whether it\u2019s sharing that data with other Alphabet companies working on AI like Google or DeepMind.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Waymo for more information and will update this post if the company responds.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo is, to date, the only autonomous vehicle company pulling in revenue for robotaxi rides in the United States. As of February, the company is logging <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/waymo-has-doubled-its-weekly-robotaxi-rides-in-less-than-a-year/\">more than 200,000 paid robotaxi rides</a> every week via its commercial services in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin. That\u2019s up from 10,000 rides per week just two years ago and is a harbinger of more growth as Waymo expands into new markets. The company aims to launch a commercial service in Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C., over the next two years.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite these gains, Waymo is still likely a money loser for Alphabet, which might be why the company appears to be exploring other revenue streams, like in-vehicle advertising and data sharing for generative AI models.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Alphabet poured <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/23/alphabet-to-invest-another-5b-into-waymo/\">another $5 billion</a> into Waymo, and the company raised an additional <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/waymos-latest-funding-round-boosts-it-to-45b-valuation/\">$5.6 billion</a> from outside investors that boosted its valuation to more than $45 billion.\u00a0</p>",

            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Baglino was a longtime employee at Tesla, starting at the company in 2006, two years before Elon Musk took over as CEO. He rose through the ranks, designing the powertrain for the first Model S and leading engineering for Tesla\u2019s battery storage products before being named senior vice president of powertrain and energy.</p>",

            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In founding Heron Power, Baglino is tackling a part of the electrical grid that hasn\u2019t seen much innovation in over a century. Transformers have been largely unchanged in that time, and having been commoditized, the majority of them are now made overseas.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solid-state transformers are more capable than existing transformers, regulating dips in voltage that might arise from solar panels and wind turbines. They\u2019re also a lot more compact, can quickly transition from one source of power to another, and can be actively managed, boosting grid stability.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Heron Power isn\u2019t the only startup hoping to shake up the transformer market.

            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Recently, you tweeted, \u201cWe\u2019re so close to longevity escape velocity that I urge you to remember that your sole responsibility right now is to avoid dying from something stupid.\u201d What inspired that specifically?</strong></p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I feel like we\u2019re in the midst of a healthspan revolution. And this is not by chance. It\u2019s the impact of mostly AI, computation, sensors, single-cell sequencing, cellular medicines \u2014 a whole slew of converging technologies [that] are helping us understand why we age, how to slow it, stop it, potentially reverse it. There\u2019s a concept called longevity escape velocity, and it\u2019s the notion that today, for every year that you\u2019re alive, science and medicine are extending your lifespan by a certain amount of time, between a quarter of a year per year to a third of a year per year. But there will be a point at which, for every year that you\u2019re alive, science extends your life for more than a year. Aubrey de Grey and Ray Kurzweil pioneered the idea, I\u2019ve researched it, I\u2019ve invested in it. And the current thinking is that we\u2019re going to hit longevity escape velocity \u2014 if you\u2019re of reasonable means and in good health \u2014 sometime in the next decade. And if that\u2019s the case, you don\u2019t want to miss it. You know, you want to be in good enough health, and you want to be here.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What does \u201creasonable means\u201d mean? Because obviously there\u2019s a lot of concern about what\u2019s been happening in our society [regarding access to healthcare], let alone around the world. The numbers have been moving in the wrong direction.</strong></p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Is longevity only for the wealthy? Is that what you\u2019re asking? First of all, the things that you can do right now are free. First and foremost, it is your diet. What you eat is fundamentally important, right? Our bodies were never designed to consume as much sugar as we take. Sugar is a poison in the quantities that we\u2019re ingesting. We used to ingest on the order of a couple of pounds per year of sugar 200 years ago. Today, we\u2019re intaking, like, 60 pounds a year of sugar. It\u2019s a neuroinflammatory, it\u2019s a cardiac inflammatory\u2026 at the end of the day, your diet is critical. Sleep is fundamental. You need to get seven to eight hours of quality sleep, which means deep sleep and REM; the lack of that will cause you to develop a neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer\u2019s, whatever it might be. [And] exercise is the number one pro-longevity thing you can do. I\u2019m in the gym five days out of the week, lifting weights, maintaining muscle mass. It\u2019s key. Again, none of these things cost me any money. The cheapest thing, which is very powerful, is your mindset\u2026 Optimists live 15% longer than pessimists\u2026 So when people say, oh my God, longevity is only for the wealthy, I cry foul. No, it\u2019s for people who care about longevity and want to focus on this.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>So that\u2019s the base layer\u2026</strong></p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There\u2019s a next tier of things that begin to cost you access to money, and these include medications and supplements. I take a ridiculous number of meds and supplements every day, but I built up to that over time. And then there\u2019s advanced testing to catch disease early; the testing ranges in price from 500 bucks to 50,000 bucks, depending on how deep you want to go.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there\u2019s one last important thing. One of the hottest areas of longevity research is called epigenetic reprogramming. So we are all born with 3.2 billion letters from our mom and 3.2 billion letters from our dad. It\u2019s our genome. It\u2019s our software\u2026 and you have the same genome when you\u2019re born, when you\u2019re 20, when you\u2019re 50, when you\u2019re 100. So why do you look different? It\u2019s what genes are on and what genes are off. It\u2019s sort of the control mechanism for turning on and off the genes in different tissues of the body as we age. So the hottest area of investment \u2014 and I\u2019m invested in some of these companies as well \u2014 is epigenetic reprogramming. Can I reprogram your epigenome to take you back to a more youthful state?\u2026 In the beginning, when it\u2019s risky and it doesn\u2019t work well, yeah, the billionaires will take the risks. But once it begins working well, and we\u2019re talking single-digit years, it\u2019ll become cheap and available to most everybody.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Is there a company that you\u2019ve invested in that really exemplifies your approach to longevity?</strong></p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the last 30 years [as the founder of the XPRIZE Foundation], we\u2019ve launched about $600 million in prizes, driving $10 billion in R&amp;D. And a year and a half ago, I raised $157 million and launched a <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/prizes/healthspan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">healthspan XPRIZE</a>. So it\u2019s $111 million of prize money. The rest of it is to run the competition and do all the testing. And in this XPRIZE, teams have to demonstrate the ability to reverse the functional aging in cognition, immune, and muscle, meaning in populations 60 to 80 years old, if I give you this therapy from the winning team, are you now thinking as clearly and capable as you were 20 years ago? Is your ability to mount an immune reaction that of you 20 years younger? Is your ability to build and maintain muscle that of you 20 years younger? And we have like 620 teams enter that XPRIZE. It\u2019ll be awarded by 2030. We\u2019re about to give away $10 million of the money to the top 40 teams; they\u2019re getting a quarter million dollars each in May of this year. So I\u2019m super excited. There are all kinds of approaches you can imagine with 620 teams in the competition.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>How would you differentiate your thinking about longevity with what Bryan Johnson is doing at <a href=\"https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Blueprint</a>?</strong></p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I\u2019ve known Bryan for 10 years. I got him into the longevity business when he sold Braintree and he moved to LA. I had [co-founded] a company called Human Longevity\u2026 down in San Diego, and Bryan became an investor in that and a board member in the company, and we parted ways. So how do I put this? You know, what Bryan is doing is n-of-one experimentation. I\u2019m super happy he\u2019s doing it. He\u2019s sort of a pioneer, and we\u2019ll see what happens there. I don\u2019t necessarily think I\u2019d be talking about my erections at night as much as he does, but I guess he gets a lot of attention in the media. The approach I\u2019m taking here through the XPRIZE Foundation is a large-scale global competition where we\u2019re trying hundreds of different approaches. It is all being precisely measured. Every team competing has got to statistically treat enough individuals in the right age range to demonstrate that they\u2019re able to do what they say they do. So it\u2019s a massive scientifically backed, experimentally normalized competition.</p>",

            "<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/05/meta-releases-llama-4-a-new-crop-of-flagship-ai-models/\">new flagship AI models</a> Meta released on Saturday, Maverick, <a href=\"https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ranks second on LM Arena</a>, a test that has human raters compare the outputs of models and choose which they prefer. But it seems the version of Maverick that Meta deployed to LM Arena differs from the version that\u2019s widely available to developers.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As <a href=\"https://x.com/natolambert/status/1908913635373842655\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">several</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/suchenzang/status/1908938638869909724\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/ZainHasan6/status/1908943306936967597\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">researchers</a> pointed out on X, Meta noted in its announcement that the Maverick on LM Arena is an \u201cexperimental chat version.\u201d A chart on the <a href=\"http://llama.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">official Llama website</a>, meanwhile, discloses that Meta\u2019s LM Arena testing was conducted using \u201cLlama 4 Maverick optimized for conversationality.\u201d</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/05/the-ai-industry-is-obsessed-with-chatbot-arena-but-it-might-not-be-the-best-benchmark/\">As we\u2019ve written about before</a>, for various reasons, LM Arena has never been the most reliable measure of an AI model\u2019s performance. But AI companies generally haven\u2019t customized or otherwise fine-tuned their models to score better on LM Arena \u2014 or haven\u2019t admitted to doing so, at least. </p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem with tailoring a model to a benchmark, withholding it, and then releasing a \u201cvanilla\u201d variant of that same model is that it makes it challenging for developers to predict exactly how well the model will perform in particular contexts. It\u2019s also misleading. Ideally, benchmarks \u2014 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/heres-why-most-ai-benchmarks-tell-us-so-little/\">woefully inadequate as they are</a> \u2014 provide a snapshot of a single model\u2019s strengths and weaknesses across a range of tasks.</p>",
            "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, researchers on X have <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/TheXeophon/status/1908900306580074741\">observed stark</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/TheXeophon/status/1908900306580074741\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">differences in the behavior</a> of the publicly downloadable Maverick compared with the model hosted on LM Arena. The LM Arena version seems to use a lot of emojis, and give incredibly long-winded answers.</p>",
