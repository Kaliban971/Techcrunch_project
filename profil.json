            "in 2021, but most startup valuations have come down from the highs seen during the era of easy money. ",
            "Usually, a down round can be cause for concern, as it might reflect diminished investor confidence among slower-than-expected progress. That said, it’s a tough funding environment out there. It’s also possible that in Nuro’s case, the company may need less capital as it pursues a recent business pivot that now focuses on licensing its self-driving technology to automotive OEMs, commercial delivery fleets, and ride-hail companies. ",

            "After several rounds of layoffs and putting its manufacturing plans on hold, Nuro decided to focus instead on beefing out its self-driving technology, which it had been continuously testing in California and Texas. In September 2024, Dave Ferguson, Nuro’s co-founder and president, told TechCrunch the company would rely on advancements in AI to accelerate its autonomy progress, which would extend its runway from 1.5 years to 3.5 years. ",
            "This new round doesn’t necessarily seem to extend that runway further. A Nuro spokesperson told TechCrunch the round will support commercial expansion plans through 2027. ",
            "Despite the down round, it’s a good sign for Nuro that its backers are mostly existing institutional investors – like T. Rowe Price Associates, Fidelity Management & Research Company, Tiger Global Management, Greylock Partners, and XN LP – as well as strategic partners. ",
            "“We’re excited to see strong investor enthusiasm for our Series E,” said Jiajun Zhu, co-founder and CEO of Nuro, in a statement. “Our technology, years of experience with driver-out Level 4 deployments, and focus on licensing uniquely position us to help automakers, mobility platforms, and commercial fleets accelerate their autonomy roadmaps.”",

            ", is using generative AI to speed up that work, believing its tech is uniquely suited to the needs of patent attorneys who need both domain expertise and legal knowledge to do their work. ",
            "Solve offers an in-browser document editor that works like Google Docs but is powered by an AI model to help attorneys with the drafting and writing required for IP work and filing patents. The company says its AI can help with patent drafting, office action response, claim charting, and invention disclosure generation and enhancement. ",
            "Now, the startup has raised $12 million in a Series A funding round, led by 20VC, to further build its momentum on the back of growing traction, a widening customer base and increasing revenue. ",
            "Solve’s co-founder and CEO, Chris Parsonson, told TechCrunch the startup’s product is now used by 200 IP teams across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, including manufacturers like Siemens and Avery Dennison, as well as law firms DLA Piper and Finnegan — all without any sales or marketing staff. ",
            "“We now have millions of dollars in ARR, our revenue has been growing ~25% month-on-month since our launch, and we’ve hired a team of world-class patent attorneys, AI researchers, and software engineers,” Parsonson said.

            "Some of that traction seems to have come not only due to more enterprises allowing their lawyers to use AI, but thanks to advances in AI development have helped the startup flesh out its product. ",
            "“Eighteen months ago, it wasn’t possible to build software for patent workflows. Now it is,” said co-founder and chief research officer Saj Ahilan. “We have built evaluations and algorithms to bridge the gap between the output from off-the-shelf AI models such as ChatGPT and professional-grade legal content.”",
            "The startup will use the Series A proceeds to scale its product, hire staff, and open a new office in New York this year. The company has 15 employees and it plans to hire around 20 people over the next year. Microsoft’s Venture Fund (",
            "), Thomson Reuters Ventures and Y Combinator also participated in the round. This round brings Solve’s total capital raised to $15 million.",
            "Some of that money is also going toward R&D for life science applications. Parsonson said Solve is working with some large pharmaceutical companies and law firms to expand its patent drafting and patent prosecution functionality to help with sequence listing and patents.",
            "“We’ll double down on R&D investment to build more functionality for life science customers,” Parsonson told TechCrunch. “In addition, we’ll be investing heavily in expanding our product beyond drafting and prosecution to freedom-to-operate analysis, claim chart licensing and litigation, as well as patent portfolio analysis and management tools for in-house IP teams.”",

            "But Parsonson thinks his startup stands out in terms of its AI output quality, customization ability, and UX.",
            "“Every patent attorney has a different style in which they like to draft patent applications, respond to office actions, and more,” Parsonson said. “The most popular feature of our product is the ability to customize the AI to a user’s own unique style, and then switch between different styles for different jurisdictions, technology fields and clients. Users and IP teams can build out their own proprietary library of customized AI styles.”",
            "He also claimed that Solve’s strategic partnerships with its investors like Microsoft and Thomson Reuters will help it expand its offerings and serve AI systems tailored for patents on a large scale. “Legal workflows are deeply embedded in Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Word. Our strategic partnership with Microsoft will enable us to deepen our integrations with Word.”",

            "First, U.S. tariff hikes are raising questions around the future of global trade, including the impact on smaller companies across the world that sell goods to U.S. consumers. Nearly a third of London-based Lyst’s revenues currently come from sales in the U.S.",

            "Lyst has leaned into the long tail of fashion brand aggregation in a marketplace model: It claims to offer products from 27,000 brands, including both designers and retailers.

            "However, not only did the IPO window slam shut a few months later, but a lot of the gains e-commerce companies saw during that period quickly deflated as consumers returned to their pre-pandemic spending habits. And then investors moved on to the next big thing, AI.",
            "And the fashion e-commerce market, more specifically, has remained difficult.",
            "A spokesperson explained that Lyst’s 160 million users are “annual unique users,” but that figure includes active shoppers as well as those just window shopping. It’s hard to know how successful the company’s conversion strategy (important for e-commerce companies) has been. And it has not been alone — other big names in high-end fashion commerce like Farfetch have also ",

            "Lyst remained unprofitable in that time, but it did manage to narrow its loss drastically over that year to £510,000 from £23.7 million a year before. It also posted an operating profit before taxes of £443,000.",

            "found that 51% of Gen Zers favor TikTok over Google Search, primarily for its short-form video format.",
            "Mosseri’s comments indicate that Meta knows the next frontier where Instagram needs to compete is as a search engine, not just a social network for keeping up with friends. ",
            "Only a “very small percentage” of average users (non-creators) post to Instagram’s Feed on a given day, he also said, adding that this part of Instagram is becoming “much more of a public domain.”  Stories and DMs (direct messages), meanwhile, are where users interact with their friends. ",
            "Another area where Instagram aims to compete with TikTok on search is the recommended searches that appear at the top of the comments section. ",
            "On TikTok, the suggested search is extracted from what people are talking about in the comments. That’s something Instagram wants to improve, too.",
            "“Sometimes, where the real interesting context is not … in the video that someone uploaded, but in the context around it — which is almost always in the comments. And so what we’re trying to do is surface that more easily, and then you can go and find out more,” he said.",
            "He noted that the version of Instagram’s app that looks more toward the comments to enhance search suggestions is coming out “soon.”",

            "A new company, ",
            ", has emerged from stealth with a family of openly available AI models that can be switched between “reasoning” and non-reasoning modes.",
            "Reasoning models like OpenAI’s ",
            " have shown great promise in domains like math and physics, thanks to their ability to effectively fact-check themselves by working through complex problems step by step. This reasoning comes at a cost, however: higher computing and latency. That’s why ",
            " are pursuing “hybrid” model architectures that combine reasoning components with standard, non-reasoning elements. Hybrid models can quickly answer simple questions while spending additional time considering more challenging queries.  ",
            "All of Deep Cogito’s models, called Cogito 1, are hybrid models. Cogito claims that they outperform the best open models of the same size, including models from Meta and Chinese AI startup ",
            ".",
            "“Each model can answer directly […] or self-reflect before answering (like reasoning models),” the company ",
            ". “[All] were developed by a small team in approximately 75 days.”",
            "The Cogito 1 models range from 3 billion parameters to 70 billion parameters, and Cogito says that models ranging up to 671 billion parameters will join them in the coming weeks and months. Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills, with more parameters generally being better.",
            "Cogito 1 wasn’t developed from scratch, to be clear. Deep Cogito built on top of Meta’s open Llama and Alibaba’s Qwen models to create its own. The company says that it applied novel training approaches to boost the base models’ performance and enable toggleable reasoning. ",
            "According to the results of Cogito’s internal benchmarking, the largest Cogito 1 model, Cogito 70B, with reasoning outperforms DeepSeek’s R1 reasoning model on a few mathematics and language evaluations. Cogito 70B with reasoning disabled also eclipses Meta’s recently released Llama 4 Scout model on LiveBench, a general-purpose AI test.",
            "Every Cogito 1 model is available for download or use via APIs on cloud providers Fireworks AI and Together AI.",
            "“Currently, we’re still in the early stages of [our] scaling curve, having used only a fraction of compute typically reserved for traditional large language model post/continued training,” wrote Cogito in its blog post. “Moving forward, we’re investigating complementary post-training approaches for self-improvement.”",
            ", San Francisco-based Deep Cogito was founded in June 2024. The company’s ",
            " lists two co-founders, Drishan Arora and Dhruv Malhotra. Malhotra was previously a product manager at Google AI lab DeepMind, where he worked on generative search technology. Arora was a senior software engineer at Google.",
            "Deep Cogito, whose backers include South Park Commons, ",
            ", ambitiously aims to build “general superintelligence.” The company’s founders understand the phrase to mean AI that can perform tasks better than most humans and “uncover entirely new capabilities we have yet to imagine.”",

            "This approach — subsidizing a low-margin manufacturing business with a higher-margin accessories play — is one that has been used by automakers, including Harley-Davidson with its apparel division and Jeep-maker Stellantis with its Mopar parts and service division. ",
            "Unsurprisingly, Slate is already pulling experience from both of those companies as it builds out its team. ",
            "The startup’s executive chairman is Rodney Copes, who spent 20 years at Harley-Davidson. Chief Financial Officer Ryan Green spent nearly a decade on the finance side of the motorcycle manufacturer. (Copes and Green also had stints at Rivian.) Slate’s heads of service, commercial, accessories product management, and growth marketing also worked at Harley-Davidson. ",
            "Slate apparently plans to source its high-voltage battery pack, electric motors, and other related tech from outside suppliers, according to one job listing. The startup is “challenging the status quo of vehicle design,” according to another listing for a design/release engineer for windshield wipers. A posting for an accountant role says the person hired would have to help implement the “required systems to be a public company.” ",
            "According to another role, any prospective head of PR and communications: “Must love cars! You’ll be thinking about cars all day every day, and it’s the most fun when you love cars.”",
            "Another way Slate appears to be bucking the trend of other EV startups is that it does not have a founder serving as CEO. ",
            "Arnone is considered to be Slate’s founder, according to the sources who spoke to TechCrunch, but his day-to-day job is serving as CEO of Re:Build Manufacturing.",

Barman eventually became the vice president of electrical and electronics for Fiat Chrysler, where she led the automaker’s integration of Android Automotive and spent time working on the company’s collaboration with Waymo, before leaving the company in 2017.",
            "Barman has not spent the last decade posting online like many of her EV startup CEO peers. She instead has mostly been advising companies on emerging tech and teaching engineering before getting involved in 2022 with what at the time was a nascent EV project within Re:Build Manufacturing.",

            "On Monday, the “de-extinction” startup Colossal Biosciences announced its most ambitious results to date: the dire wolf. These are creatures that have been extinct for more than 12,000 years and made famous by the HBO show “Game of Thrones.”",
            "These white, fluffy animals live on a 2,000-acre preserve in a location so secretive that journalists, including from TechCrunch, who were invited to view the live animals, were not invited to the compound itself, located in the northern United States. Instead we flew to another secretive location to see the animals with our own eyes because in this age of AI, a photo can’t be trusted.  ",
            "There we saw two six-month-old males named Remus and Romulus, each already weighing about 80 pounds. They looked to an inexperienced eye like very big wild dogs with slightly larger skulls and an elongated muzzle. In addition to Remus and Romulus, the company’s engineered dire wolf pack includes a female named Khaleesi, who is two months old.",
            "But the company says that there’s very little that’s ordinary about them. Colossal’s dire wolves are the result of an 18-month effort based on the genes found in the fossils of a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull of the extinct animals.",
            "When Colossal Biosciences announced its latest fundraise at a",
            " earlier this year, the company’s co-founder and CEO Ben Lamm told TechCrunch he believed the startup was undervalued given its actual scientific progress.",
            "Given the common startup tendency to overstate capabilities, it wasn’t easy to take Lamm’s claims at face value, particularly since Colossal’s ambitious de-extinction projects for the woolly mammoth and Tasmanian tiger were not slated for completion until 2028.",
            "Since then, the company introduced breakthroughs that Colossal hoped would quell the skeptics’ doubts about its scientific advancements. Last month, the company announced that it engineered a mouse with",
            ". The woolly mice generated a lot of excitement. ",
            "But clearly, with the dire wolves, the company has taken its animal creation to a new level.",
            "The company’s researchers compared the ancient DNA with the gray wolf and found that the species are 99.5% genetically identical. The scientists then used CRISPR technology to edit gray wolf cells with 20 genes that govern the dire wolf’s outward appearance. The genetically modified cells were turned into embryos, which were implanted into a large domestic dog, who then gave birth to the dire wolf pups.",
            "The result, the company claims, is the first extinct species to be brought back to life.",
            "But many scientists who are not working for Colossal question whether they represent a true species revival.",
            "“It is an impressive feat of genome editing, but I would not call it de-extinction,” David Gold, a professor of Paleobiology at UC Davis, told TechCrunch. “They have taken a grey wolf and modified some of its genes to mimic a dire wolf, making a sort of grey wolf / dire wolf hybrid. These animals are not being raised in a pack by other dire wolves, and they are not hunting in the wild, so I suspect their behavior will be different from a real dire wolf as well.”",

            "This approach — subsidizing a low-margin manufacturing business with a higher-margin accessories play — is one that has been used by automakers, including Harley-Davidson with its apparel division and Jeep-maker Stellantis with its Mopar parts and service division. ",
            "Unsurprisingly, Slate is already pulling experience from both of those companies as it builds out its team. ",
            "The startup’s executive chairman is Rodney Copes, who spent 20 years at Harley-Davidson. Chief Financial Officer Ryan Green spent nearly a decade on the finance side of the motorcycle manufacturer. (Copes and Green also had stints at Rivian.) Slate’s heads of service, commercial, accessories product management, and growth marketing also worked at Harley-Davidson. ",

A posting for an accountant role says the person hired would have to help implement the “required systems to be a public company.” ",
            "According to another role, any prospective head of PR and communications: “Must love cars! You’ll be thinking about cars all day every day, and it’s the most fun when you love cars.”",
            "Another way Slate appears to be bucking the trend of other EV startups is that it does not have a founder serving as CEO. ",

            "These white, fluffy animals live on a 2,000-acre preserve in a location so secretive that journalists, including from TechCrunch, who were invited to view the live animals, were not invited to the compound itself, located in the northern United States. Instead we flew to another secretive location to see the animals with our own eyes because in this age of AI, a photo can’t be trusted.  ",
            "There we saw two six-month-old males named Remus and Romulus, each already weighing about 80 pounds. They looked to an inexperienced eye like very big wild dogs with slightly larger skulls and an elongated muzzle. In addition to Remus and Romulus, the company’s engineered dire wolf pack includes a female named Khaleesi, who is two months old.",
            "But the company says that there’s very little that’s ordinary about them. Colossal’s dire wolves are the result of an 18-month effort based on the genes found in the fossils of a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull of the extinct animals.",

            "But clearly, with the dire wolves, the company has taken its animal creation to a new level.",
            "The company’s researchers compared the ancient DNA with the gray wolf and found that the species are 99.5% genetically identical. The scientists then used CRISPR technology to edit gray wolf cells with 20 genes that govern the dire wolf’s outward appearance. The genetically modified cells were turned into embryos, which were implanted into a large domestic dog, who then gave birth to the dire wolf pups.",
            "The result, the company claims, is the first extinct species to be brought back to life.",

These animals are not being raised in a pack by other dire wolves, and they are not hunting in the wild, so I suspect their behavior will be different from a real dire wolf as well.”",

            "On Tuesday, Amazon debuted a new generative AI model, Nova Sonic, capable of natively processing voice and generating natural-sounding speech. Amazon claims that Sonic’s performance is competitive with frontier voice models from OpenAI and Google on benchmarks measuring speed, speech recognition, and conversational quality.",
            "Nova Sonic is Amazon’s answer to newer AI voice models such as the model powering ",
            ", which feel more natural to speak with than the more rigid models from Amazon Alexa’s early days. Recent technological breakthroughs have made legacy models and the digital assistants they underpin, such as Alexa and Apple’s Siri, seem incredibly stilted by comparison.",
            "Nova Sonic is available through Bedrock, Amazon’s developer platform for building enterprise AI applications, via a new bi-directional streaming API. In a press release, Amazon called Nova Sonic “the most cost-efficient” AI voice model on the market, and around 80% less expensive than OpenAI’s GPT-4o.",
            "Components of Nova Sonic are already powering ",
            ", according to Amazon SVP and Head Scientist of AGI Rohit Prasad.",
            "In an interview, Prasad told TechCrunch that Nova Sonic builds on Amazon’s expertise in “large orchestration systems,” the technical scaffolding that makes up Alexa. Compared to rival AI voice models, Nova Sonic excels at routing user requests to different APIs, said Prasad. This capability helps Nova Sonic “know” when it needs to fetch real-time information from the internet, parse a proprietary data source, or take action in an external application — and use the appropriate tool to do it.",
            "During a two-way dialogue, Nova Sonic waits to speak “at the appropriate time,” taking into account a speaker’s pauses and interruptions, says Amazon. It also generates a text transcript for the user’s speech, which developers can use for various applications.",
            "Nova Sonic is less prone to speech recognition errors than other AI voice models, according to Prasad, meaning the model is relatively good at understanding a user’s intent even if they mumble, misspeak, or are in a noisy setting. On a benchmark measuring speech recognition across languages and dialects, Multilingual LibriSpeech, Amazon says Nova Sonic achieved a word error rate (WER) of just 4.2% when averaged across English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish. That means that roughly four out of every 100 words from the model differed from a human transcription in those languages. ",
            "On another benchmark measuring loud interactions with multiple participants, Augmented Multi Party Interaction, Amazon says Nova Sonic was 46.7% more accurate in terms of WER than ",
            " model. Nova Sonic also has industry-leading speed, with an average perceived latency of 1.09 seconds, according to Amazon. That makes it faster than the GPT-4o model powering OpenAI’s Realtime API, which responds in 1.18 seconds, per benchmarking by Artificial Analysis.",
            "Prasad says Nova Sonic is a part of Amazon’s broader strategy to build AGI (artificial general intelligence), which the company defines as “AI systems that can do anything a human can do on a computer.” Moving forward, Prasad says Amazon plans to release more AI models that can understand different modalities, including image, video, and voice, as well as “other sensory data that are relevant if you bring things into the physical world.”",
            "Amazon’s AGI division, which Prasad oversees, seems to be playing a larger role in the company’s product strategy these days. Just last week, Amazon ",
            ", a browser-using AI model that appears to be powering elements of Alexa+ and ",
            ". Starting with Nova Sonic, Prasad says the company wants to offer more of its internal AI models for developers to build with.",

            "IBM is releasing the latest version of its mainframe hardware that includes new updates meant to accelerate AI adoption.",
            "The hardware and consulting company on Monday announced IBM z17, the latest version of its mainframe computer hardware. This fully encrypted mainframe is powered by an IBM Telum II processor and is designed for more than 250 AI use cases, the company says, including AI agents and generative AI.",
            "Mainframes might seem like old hat, but they’re used by 71% of Fortune 500 companies today, ",
            ". In 2024, the mainframe market was worth an estimated $5.3 billion, per consulting firm Market Research Future.",
            "The z17 can process 450 billion inference operations in a day, a 50% increase over its predecessor, ",
            ", which was released in 2022 and ran on the company’s original Tellum processor. The system is designed to be able to fully integrate with other hardware, software, and open source tools.",
            "Tina Tarquinio, VP of product management and design for IBM Z, told TechCrunch that this mainframe upgrade has been in the works for five years — well before the current AI frenzy that started with the release of ",
            " in November 2022.",
            "IBM spent more than 2,000 research hours getting feedback from over 100 customers as it built the z17, Tarquinio said. She thinks it’s interesting to see that, now, five years later, the feedback they got aligned with where the market ended up heading.",
            "“It has been wild knowing that we’re introducing an AI accelerator, and then seeing, especially in the later half of 2022, all of the changes in the industry regarding AI,” Tarquinio told TechCrunch. “It’s been really exciting. I think the biggest point has been [that] we don’t know what we don’t know about what’s coming, right? So the possibilities are really unlimited in terms of what AI can help us do.”",
            "The z17 is set up to adapt and accommodate where the AI market heads, Tarquinio said. The mainframe will support 48 IBM Spyre AI accelerator chips upon release, with the plan to bring that number up to 96 within 12 months.",
            "“We are purposely building in headroom,” Tarquinio said. “We’re purposely building in AI agility. So as new models are introduced, [we’re] making sure that we’ve built in the headroom for bigger, larger models — models that maybe need more local memory to talk to each other. We’ve built in that because we know it’s really the approach that will change, right? The new models will come and go.”",
            "Tarquinio said that one of the highlights of this latest hardware — although she joked it was like being asked to pick her favorite child — is that the z17 is more energy-efficient than its predecessor and supposedly competitors, too.",
            "“On-chip, we’re increasing the AI acceleration by seven and a half times, but that’s five and a half times less energy than you would need to do, like, multi-model on another type of accelerator or platform in the industry,” Tarquinio said.",
            "The z17 mainframes will become generally available on June 18.",
